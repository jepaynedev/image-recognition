# Image Recognition

Learning classic image recognition techniques

## Background

In 2021, I spent a few weeks experimenting with feature recognition and feature detection with the goals of learning about classic techniques and attempting to implement and train a small model to identify a specific class of objects (likely either board game components or Magic: The Gathering cards).

Upon reviewing the code in 2023, I found that I only remembered the high-level strategies. The details of many steps were not easy to follow.

This project will serve as a more structured implementation as I wade back through my previous work.

## Goals

- Reimplement the experimental work from an old project with better structure, documentation, and scripts required for easy reproducibility.
- Tagged steps along the way to serve as reference points for important steps along the way
