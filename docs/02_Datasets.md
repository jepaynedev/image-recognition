# Datasets

We need example datasets to work with. We will be using a dataset from [Caltech Data](https://data.caltech.edu/). Download, extraction, and organization of datasets is scripted for reproducibility.

## Script Setup

Ensure that the project is installed locally by running `pip install -e .`. This will ensure that the console scripts (specifically `dataset`) included are ready for use.

## Datasets
